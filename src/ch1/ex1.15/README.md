# Exercise 1.15

## Question

Thee sine of an angle (specified in radians) an be computed by making use of the approximation $sin x ≈ x$ if $x$ is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

$$
\sin x = 3 \sin\frac x3-4 \sin^3\frac x3
$$

to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered “suﬃciently small” if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
(if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
angle
(p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a. How many times is the procedure p applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?
b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

## Answers

> a. How many times is the procedure p applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?

When `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated, the number of times the procedure `p` is applied is 5.

Once again, I do not know, not enough math skills yet
