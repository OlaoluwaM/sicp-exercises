# Exercise 1.31

## Question

1. The `sum` procedure is only the simplest of a vast number of similar abstractions that can be captured as higher-order procedures. Write an analogous procedure called `product` that returns the product of the values of a function at points over a given range. Show how to define factorial in terms of `product`. Also use product to compute approximations to $Ï€$ using the formula: [The Wallis Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product)
2. If your product procedure generates a recursive process, write one that generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write one that generates a recursive process.
