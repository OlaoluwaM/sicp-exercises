# Exercise 1.39

## Question

A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in 1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert

$$
\tan x = \cfrac{x}{1 - \cfrac{x^2}{3 - \cfrac{x^2}{5 - \cdots}}}
$$

where `x` is in radians. Define a procedure `(tan-cf x k)` that computes an approximation to the tangent function based on Lambertâ€™s formula. `k` specifies the number of terms to compute, as in [Exercise 1.37.](code.rkt)

## Solution
