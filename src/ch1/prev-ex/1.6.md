Alyssa unleashed an infinite loop which leads the interpreter REPL to become a rogue process devouring all computing resources in sight. Why did this happen? Well, its because by switching to the custom `if` (`new-if`) procedure, Alyssa forced an applicative-order evaluation, that is, she forced the if statement to be evaluated like a normal expression.

In the following code segment,

```scheme
; proc           arg 1          arg2            arg3
( new-if (good-enough? guess x) guess (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x) )
```

Alyssa compelled the interpreter to an applicative-order approach of evaluation when she decided to swap out `if` for `new-if`. `if` is built-in, a special form, so the interpreter has a *special* way of handling it in a manner that is predictable with the languageâ€™s execution model.

Therefore, by switching to `new-if` Alyssa opted out of that special evaluation treatment for the regular one (the one that governs regular compound expressions as a whole). Thus, the interpreter would need to pre-evaluate each of the three arguments in the `new-if` compound expression and notice how the third argument is recursive.

In its evaluation, the interpreter will get caught in a never-ending cycle at the third argument, causing the entire interpretation process to spiral out of control eventuating in an infinite loop
