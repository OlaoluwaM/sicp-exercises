## Function One

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

For the above compound procedure, the resulting process would resemble the following:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5) )))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5) ))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

As we can see from the illustrated process above, the first `+` compound procedure yields a linearly recursive process that is not stack safe, denoted by the linear growth of the number deferred `inc` compound procedure calls by `a`.

## Function Two

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

For the above compound procedure, the resulting process would resemble the following:

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```

As we can see from the illustrated process above, the second `+` compound procedure yields a linearly iterative process denoted by the changes of state between recursive calls and the absence of a build up of deferred computations. All state changes are explicit. Though, similar to it's recursive counterparts, the number of ensuing tail recursive calls is proportional to value of `a`
