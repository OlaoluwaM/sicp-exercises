# Exercise 2.3

## Question

Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use of [Exercise 2.2](../ex2.2/code.rkt))

1. In terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle.

2. Now implement a different representation for rectangles.

Can you design your system with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures will work using either representation?
